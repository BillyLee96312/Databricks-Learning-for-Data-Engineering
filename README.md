# Databricks-Learning-for-Data-Engineering

****
This course includes the Associate-level modules of the Data Engineer Learning Path. These include:

Module 1: Get Started with the Databricks Data Engineering and Data Science Workspace
Module 2: Transform Data with Spark (SQL/Python)
Module 3: Manage Data with Delta Lake
Module 4: Build Data Pipelines with Delta Live Tables (SQL/Python)
Module 5: Deploy Workloads with Databricks Workflow Jobs
Module 6: Manage Data Access for Analytics with Unity Catalog (OPTIONAL)

**** 

The modules above correspond to the first six module folders in the git repository for the Data Engineer Learning Path.

Note on Unity Catalog
Module 6 requires a Databricks workspace enabled with Unity Catalog, as well as workspace administration permissions. If these are not available to you, feel free to just watch the demos or skip this content.
 
For those unable to take the Unity Catalog module, we recommend going through the optional Databricks SQL material included in the Module 5 folder of the Data Engineer Learning Path repository.
SQL vs Python
Modules 2 and 4 includes content specific to SQL or Python. If you are only interested in SQL, feel free to skip lessons for Python-only. If you are interested in programming with Python, feel free to skip lessons for SQL-only. Note that SQL is used throughout the course for both SQL and Python developers.
